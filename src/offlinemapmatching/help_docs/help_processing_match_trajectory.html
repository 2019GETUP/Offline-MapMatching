        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Network-Layer:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">This combobox shows all visible layers of the current QGIS project with the geometry type LINESTRING. The network, needed to match the trajectory on it, shall be selected. It is recommended, that this layer should be a clean graph following a node-edge-model, i.e. different lines should only touch other lines, never cross them. You can get souch a clean graph e.g. by running the PostGIS function "CreateTopology".</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Trajectory-Layer:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The combobox shows all visible layers of the current QGIS project with the geometry type POINT. The trajectory, which will be matched with the network, shall be selected.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Trajectory-ID:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The combobox shows all fields of the chosen trajectory layer. The selected field will be added to the result features, so that the vertices of the result layer can be referred to the points of the trajectory.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">CRS of output layer (EPSG):</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">Insert the EPSG code, which should be used for the result layer. It is recommended to insert the CRS of the network and trajectory layer (both layer should have the same CRS). It is also recommended to use a metric CRS.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Standard Deviation [m]:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The standard deviation of the distance between the positions from the trajectory and their possible positions on the network. It will be assumed, that the points of the trajectory  and their possible positions are normal distributed. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/jagodki/Offline-MapMatching">repository on GitHub</a> for additonal information about this setting.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Expected Value [m]:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The expected distance between the positions from the trajectory and their possible positions on the network. It is recommended to choose the value 0, i.e. ideally, the trajectory points should be on the network, if the accuracy of the coordinates would be 100%.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Maximum Search Distance [m]:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The maximum distance to find points on the network for each trajectory point. It is mandatory, that this value is greater oder equal than the highest shortest distance between all trajectory points and the whole network. This setting has a big influence on the computing time. Go to the
        <a href="https://github.com/jagodki/Offline-MapMatching">repository on GitHub</a> for further information about this setting.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">A detailed description about the algorithm is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/jagodki/Offline-MapMatching">README document</a> of the repository on GitHub.</font></p>
